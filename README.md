Midnight Theme for Jekyll Blog
==============================

Theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blogs, based on the [Midnight](https://github.com/mattgraham/Midnight) theme for github pages.



Installation
--------------

There are two ways to install.

You can either clone-and-go, copying the repository and tweaking the contents to taste, or you can cherry-pick the files you want and integrate them into an existing Jekyll instance.

If you're starting a new blog, you want to clone-and-go. Just `git clone ...`, make any changes you want to the template, pages or `_config.yml` and start blogging with Jekyll. Easy.
